# prem_league_analytics

This is the second capstone project that I completed for Springboard.
I used machine learning to produce predicted values for target transfer players for my favorite English Premier League team Arsenal!

I had a great time using pandas, Beautiful Soup, XGBoost, scikit-learn, FuzzyWuzzy, and other useful Python libraries.
