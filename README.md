# prem_league_analytics

This is the second capstone project that I completed for Springboard.
I used machine learning to produce predicted values for target transfer players for my favorite English Premier League team Arsenal!

I had a great time using pandas, Beautiful Soup, XGBoost, scikit-learn, FuzzyWuzzy, and other useful Python libraries.

Shout out to my awesome mentor Karel Verhoeven! He has a great XGBoost tutorial at https://www.kaggle.com/karelrv/nyct-from-a-to-z-with-xgboost-tutorial! Check it out!
